# About Me

I combine security expertise with machine learning to reveal hidden threat patterns and move detection toward predictive intelligence.

---

### Core Focus
- **Machine Learning for Security** – Building end-to-end ML pipelines that parse logs, enrich data, engineer features, and surface subtle anomalies that traditional tools miss.  
- **Threat Intelligence Analysis** – Collecting, organizing, and correlating threat intelligence with cybersecurity-relevant data to support predictive detection approaches.  
- **Security Data Analysis** – Converting raw logs from diverse enterprise systems into actionable insight through structured workflows.

---

### Featured Projects
- **CTA: Cyber Threat Analysis** – A reproducible machine-learning pipeline for detecting brute-force activity using log parsing, enrichment, feature engineering, and baseline modeling.  
- **ML Foundations** – Core machine-learning projects including Titanic, House Prices, and ML-from-scratch exercises to build strong foundational skills.  
- **PyTorch Journey** – A minimal sandbox for exploring deep-learning techniques and experiments.
