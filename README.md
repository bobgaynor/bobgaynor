# About Me

I combine security expertise with machine learning to reveal hidden threat patterns and move detection toward predictive intelligence.

### Core Capabilities

**ML for Security**  
Building end-to-end machine learning pipelines for log analysis, including parsing, enrichment, feature engineering, and baseline model evaluation. Focused on identifying subtle patterns and behaviors that traditional tools miss.

**Threat Intelligence Analysis**  
Collecting, organizing, and correlating threat intelligence with observed indicators and cybersecurity-relevant data to strengthen understanding of emerging threats and support predictive detection approaches.

**Security Data Analysis**  
Analyzing system and network logs to identify anomalies and technical indicators using structured, repeatable workflows designed to separate noise from actionable signals.
