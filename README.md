## Featured Projects

### Cyber Threat Analyzer (CTA)
End-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting anomalies and threats in system logs.  
- [View Project](https://github.com/bobgaynor/cta)

### Machine Learning Foundations
A collection of small, focused projects designed to strengthen ML fundamentals.  

Planned work includes Titanic classification, House Prices regression, and a model built from scratch.

## Machine Learning Journey

This journey is focused on building a strong foundation in machine learning through structured, hands-on exploration.

**Milestone 1 — CTA Project**  
Completed an end-to-end ML workflow involving data pipelines, modeling, and evaluation. This project set the foundation for deeper study.

**Milestone 2 — Classic ML Foundations** *(in progress)*  
Currently focused on strengthening machine learning intuition through hands-on projects.  

Planned work includes the Titanic classification and House Prices regression datasets.

**Milestone 3 — ML from Scratch** *(up next)*  
Will implement linear or logistic regression in NumPy to understand loss, gradients, and weight updates from first principles.

**Milestone 4 — PyTorch Journey** *(planned)*  
Will document progress through *AI and ML for Coders in PyTorch* in the `pytorchjourney` repository, focusing on comprehension and experimentation.

**Milestone 5 — Reflection and Growth** *(ongoing)*  
Regularly documenting progress, connecting classical ML and deep learning concepts, and exploring new datasets and ideas.
