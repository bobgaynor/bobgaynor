## Featured Projects

### Cyber Threat Analyzer (CTA)
Machine learning pipeline for detecting anomalies and potential threats in system logs, helping filter the noise to reveal actionable intelligence.  
- [View Project](https://github.com/bobgaynor/cta)

### Machine Learning Foundations
A collection of small, focused projects designed to strengthen ML fundamentals.  

Planned work includes *Titanic* classification, *House Prices* regression, and a model built from scratch.

## Machine Learning Journey

This journey is focused on building a strong foundation in machine learning through structured, hands-on exploration.

**Milestone 1 - CTA Project**  
Completed an end-to-end ML workflow involving data pipelines, modeling, and evaluation. This project set the foundation for deeper study.

**Milestone 2 - Classic ML Foundations** *(in progress)*  
Currently focused on strengthening machine learning intuition through hands-on projects.  

Planned work includes the *Titanic* classification and *House Prices* regression datasets.

**Milestone 3 - ML from Scratch** *(up next)*  
Will build a simple regression model from scratch in NumPy to understand how predictions, errors, and model updates work.

**Milestone 4 - PyTorch Journey** *(planned)*  
Will document progress through *AI and ML for Coders in PyTorch* in the `pytorchjourney` repository, focusing on comprehension and experimentation.

**Milestone 5 - Reflection and Growth** *(ongoing)*  
Regularly documenting progress, connecting classical ML and deep learning concepts, and exploring new datasets and ideas.
